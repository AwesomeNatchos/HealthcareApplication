# HealthcareApplication

Creating health care applicatication as a University project.

Goal of project:
  1. Be able to register different users.
      - Admin, Doctor, Patient and FamilyMebers.
  2. Every user can log in with unique userID (int) and password (str)
  3. Different users will be able to access different pages in the system.
  4. Creating and deleting users should be possible into an xml file.
      PROBLEM! Having problems reading from the file, can someone please comment and have a look?
  5. I want to be able to connect different users to each other, eg Doctor to patients.
      Doctors should be able to see all patients, but patients can only see family members and doctor.
